# Instagram-Influencer-Classification
Type of influencer classification : Mega / Mid-Tier / Macro / Micro / Nano

Automated Instagram Influencer Classification

I have developed my first classification model using Pycaret to predict the type of influencer
based on information scraped from their Instagram handle.

I scraped an individual's profile metrics, formulated, computed a dataset, and labeled them as
Mega, Mid-Tier, Macro, Micro, Nano type of #influencers. I have restricted the domain to sports,
it would help the related businesses to classify potentially rewarding influencers based on their
engagement rate.

With the focus on nano/micro-influencer marketing, reach is not the best thing to focus on.
With nano users having between 500 and 5000 followers, all of them being friends, family members,
coworkers, etc. Their authenticity is unmatched, and so are their results in terms of return on investment.

Here, I have mimicked the screening process of potential influencers, by web scraping, dataset formulating,
model building. 

Problem with this method of scraping is, it takes time for third party APIs to fetch the data, Logging
into the account frequently might lead to account lockout issue.
